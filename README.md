# üåü Homelab to Production AI Golden Path

Welcome to the **homelab-2-prod-ai-golden-path** repository! This project serves as a comprehensive guide to exploring AI from your local homelab to production. We focus on open-source software (OSS) to maintain technological independence and enhance privacy with local large language models (LLMs).

## üìñ Introduction

In today‚Äôs rapidly evolving tech landscape, the need for AI solutions is more significant than ever. However, many existing solutions rely heavily on cloud services, which can pose risks to privacy and control. This repository provides a **golden path** to leverage AI in a way that keeps you in control. 

Our approach includes:

- **Local Homelab Setup**: Build your AI environment on your own hardware.
- **Open Source Software**: Utilize freely available tools to avoid vendor lock-in.
- **Privacy-Focused Solutions**: Keep your data local with LLMs and other technologies.

## üß† Key Concepts

### AI Agents

AI agents are systems that can perform tasks autonomously. They learn from their environment and adapt to new situations. In this project, we explore how to create and deploy these agents effectively.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG combines traditional search with generative models. It allows for more accurate and contextually relevant responses. We will implement RAG in our projects using various tools.

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs are a type of AI that can understand and generate human-like text. We focus on local implementations to ensure privacy and security.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project utilizes a variety of technologies to build a robust AI environment:

- **Linux**: The backbone of our homelab setup.
- **Opentofu**: A tool for managing cloud resources.
- **MicroK8s**: Lightweight Kubernetes for deploying applications.
- **DAPR**: A framework for building microservices.
- **Ollama**: A tool for managing and deploying LLMs.
- **TimescaleDB**: A time-series database for data storage.
- **pgai Vectorizer**: For vectorizing data.
- **Flask**: A web framework for building APIs.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for our scripts.
